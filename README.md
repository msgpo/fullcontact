# Polarity FullContact Integration

Polarity's  Full Contact integration gives users access to automated email lookups against the FullContact REST API.
The Full Contact integration passes extracted email addresses to the Full Contact API, and notifies Polarity analysts as to social media records associated with the address.

The integration is ideal for analysts performing open source intelligence, performing background investigations or fulfilling sales or research functions.
